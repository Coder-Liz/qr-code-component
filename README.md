## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to really do the correct HTML syntax

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>I made the H1 visually-hidden</h1>
```

```css
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute;
  left: -10000px;
  top: auto;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

I am using the var() function in my color property.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I want to learn more about CSS Grid, animations and javascript.
